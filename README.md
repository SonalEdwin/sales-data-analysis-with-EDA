## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data for trends in monthly sales, city-wise performance, peak sales hours, and product demand. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and creating visualizations to understand the patterns in the sales data. It also involves market basket analysis to identify commonly bought product combinations.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing values, duplicates, and erroneous data to ensure high data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting useful features such as Month, Hour, and City from the existing dataset to enhance analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations like bar charts and line graphs to explore sales trends.
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifying frequently purchased product pairs to assist in product bundling strategies.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating sales metrics and exploring the relationship between product pricing and demand.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `Counter` from `collections` for association analysis
  - `os` for file handling and directory management

## Data Overview
The dataset contains sales records for multiple months, including information on:
- Order Date
- Product Names
- Quantity Ordered
- Price Each
- Purchase Address

The data has been cleaned to remove errors, missing values, and duplicates to ensure that the analysis is accurate and reliable.
